/**
 * This factory produces composite runners. Each of them launches two runners (backward and forward)
 * on the same unit with the same startMethods.
 *
 * Backward runner is launched on the reversed application graph,
 * while forward runner is launched on the direct graph.
 *
 * Both runners will be given their own managers with the following policy:
 * - all [NewSummaryFact] events are delegated to the outer manager
 * - [EdgeForOtherRunnerQuery] events are submitted to the other runner if the corresponding edge
 * belongs to the same unit, otherwise they are transmitted to the outer manager (for forward runner)
 * or ignored (for backward runner)
 * - Queue is thought to be empty when queues of both forward and backward runners are empty.
 * The [QueueEmptinessChanged] event is sent to outer manager correspondingly.
 * - [SubscriptionForSummaryEdges] event is delegated to the outer manager for forward runner and
 * is ignored for backward runner
 *
 * @param forwardRunnerFactory a factory that produces forward runner for each [newRunner] call
 * @param backwardRunnerFactory a factory that produces backward runner for each [newRunner] call
 * @param isParallel if true, the produced composite runner will launch backward and forward runners in parallel.
 * Otherwise, the backward runner will be executed first, and after it, the forward runner will be executed.
